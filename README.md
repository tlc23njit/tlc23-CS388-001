## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Android Studio just kept giving me random errors that I did not know how to solve. One time the emulator just kept blackscreening, so I just reset the application. Another time it said my xml file wasn't right even though it was, so I had to just restart the holy project and copy pasted the code into a new Empty Activity view and it was magically fixed. Another time, my emulator app just told me UI was not responding everytime I used it, then I took a break and it was magically fixed when I got back.
