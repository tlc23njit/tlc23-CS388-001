## Overview

### Description

An app that allows people to set up their own Jeopardy Board and games and also add their own questions

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- Category: Social/Education/Entertainment
- Mobile: Ease of Use. Has Audio, Push, and RealTime
- Story: I would use this with my friends and family a lot. The app's idea is very simple
- Market: Very large market for trivia players and creators. There's probably a lot of other apps out there also though
- Habit: I don't think people will build a habit to using this app. It's more of a big event type of thing rather than a daily thing
- Scope: I believe I know almost everything I need to know to complete this project. This will be very interesting to build because it still holds some new challenges like the game aspect
